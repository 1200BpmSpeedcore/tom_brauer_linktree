          I'm Tom Brauer (nickname Avery), a {{currentAge()}} years old junior software developer from the city of Leipzig, Germany.

        <p class="lead">
          I discovered my passion for code not through theory but in hands-on experiences. After a short stay at an university where I studied computer science I decided to pursue a more practical path. During my training I dove headfirst into the depths of the .NET world, designed and developed my own software from the ground up and wasn't limited to just bug fixes. The result was a tailor-made solution for visualizing IT assets. That experience showed me: I'm driven by solving concrete problems with clean code.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Today I specialize in building modern web applications using Angular for the frontend and .NET for the backend. I'm constantly expanding my skill set and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies to deliver efficient and scalable solutions.

      <strong>Liability for Contents</strong><br>
      As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages under general law according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG. However,

      <strong>Liability for Links</strong><br>
      My website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any
